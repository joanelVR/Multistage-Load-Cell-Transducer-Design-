# Multistage-Load-Cell-Transducer-Design
##### For this project, I develop a multi-staged load cell to accommodate three orders of magnitude load. A beam strain gage measurement system was used to design the multi-staged load cell. Each beam in the configuration was instrumented with strain gages to design this transducer. In order to allow for different sensitivities, three different beams were used.
##### A mathematical model was developed in excel for this multi-staged load cell configuration. Simple beam theory and deflection/stress/strain calculations were used for this design. The system was designed to optimize the 5 volt signal input of the analog to digital converter of the data acquisition system.
